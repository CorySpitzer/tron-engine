##Sam's Recursive Tron Bot

> gcc sams_bot.c sams_tronlib.c -o sams_bot

My not quite working tron bot. The algorithm is correctly implemented, however memory leaks cause it to break within the first few moves on any map I've tried. With that said, if it is tried on empty-room.txt, it does log to 'logs/sams_bot.log' its decision making process.
